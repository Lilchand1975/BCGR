                An approach is made to forecast participation in unique cultural events with long gestation periods. Experimental observations
                of choice are derived for conjoint measurement type multiattribute alternatives that describe possible event
                configurations. The choice data are analyzed by means of discrete choice econometric models. This platform
                will provide an opportunity to local artists to showcase their talents before a huge crowd. A multinomial
                logit choice model is applied to forecast the choice of attendance at various types of international expositions.
                The empirical work was part of the planning efforts undertaken to investigate the potential demand for an
                international exposition to be held in Eastern Australia in conjunction with the Australian 1988 bicentennial
                celebrations.
